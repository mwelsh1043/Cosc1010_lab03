#We are going to start with the basics. Declare a list  states that contains the elements: Wyoming, Colorado, Montana in that order 
#Note this is the ONLY point where you need to declare the states list



#print the entire list


#now print the first element in the list


#Print the last element using the syntax shown in class to access the final element (hint, think negatives)


#Using an F-string to access the first and second element print the string "COLORADO is south of WYOMING", matching the casing provided



#Part Two [10pts] 2pts each
print("Part Two------------------------------------------------------------------------")
#Append the following states to your list: Washington, Oregon, California and print your list


#Again using the specific syntax mentioned in class overwrite the second to last element to be Maine, printing the list 


#Insert the state Texas to be the third element in the list, again printing your list


#Using the `del` statement remove the fourth item from the list, print your list 


#Remove Texas using its value, print the list


#Part Three [10pts] 3pts each,  that means a free point built in!
print("Part Three----------------------------------------------------------------------")
#Temporarily sort your list, print it both sorted and unsorted 


#Permanently sort your list in reverse order, printing it out
